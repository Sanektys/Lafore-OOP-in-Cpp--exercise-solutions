As he begins a week of self-isolation, France's Emmanuel Macron is facing questions over the precautions he may or may not have taken in the lead-up to his testing positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.
The president released a selfie video on Friday, saying he was feeling fine but his work had "slowed down a little because of the virus".
Over the previous week President Macron attended a number of high-profile events, including an EU summit and a working dinner with political heavyweights at the Elysee Palace on Wednesday night.
Many of the officials and foreign leaders he met have themselves begun self-isolating too.
Mr Macron's office strongly denies claims that he acted recklessly. In his video he said he had caught the virus despite taking great care, through "no doubt a moment of carelessness, a moment of bad luck too".
The president is no ordinary Covid patient. He may be shielding from other people, but he cannot shield from questions about his condition and the decisions he took.

How did Macron get Covid?
We can only guess. Given the incubation period, he may have become infected at a two-day meeting of European Council heads of state in Brussels on Thursday and Friday last week.
